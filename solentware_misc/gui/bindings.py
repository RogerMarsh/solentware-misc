"""Provide interface to tkinter bind and unbind methods.

Tcl/Tk uses the bind command to bind and unbind sequences; where giving the
empty string implements the removal of the current binding.

Adopting the same technique with the tkinter bind method causes a memory
leak.  The Python idiom is 'id = w.bind(seq); w.unbind(seq, funcid=a)',
where unbind calls Tcl/Tk bind the Tcl/Tk way, and avoids memory leaks.

This technique is described in the docstrings for tkinter bind and unbind.

(I managed to not notice this point for 20 years!; using tkinter bind as if
it were Tcl/Tk bind.)
