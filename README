To install the rmappsup package type

python setup.py install

at the command prompt with setup.py in the current directory.


This is rmappsup-0.29


Dependencies:

Python 2.6 or Python 2.7 installed.
basesup-0.8 package from www.solentware.co.uk.
gridsup-0.8 package from www.solentware.co.uk.


Notes:

There are three kinds of modules in this package.  Those implementing facilities that do not have an obvious home elsewhere (bz2textapi.py for example); those for which a decision has not been made (dptdatasource.py for example); and those which do things the way I want to do them (gui/frame.py and gui/panel.py for example).
